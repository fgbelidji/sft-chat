## Description
This repo contains scripts and notebooks to showcase how to perform Supervised fine-tuning of LLMs with the Hugging Face ecosystem and AWS Sagemaker.

It is mostly inspired by the work presented in [The Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) and the [Sagemaker Section of the Hugging Face notebooks repository](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/tree/main/sagemaker).

## Content

- `mistral-7B/`: Examples notebooks to fine-tune [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) on an English conversational dataset on a machine with a single consumer GPU and on AWS Sagemaker instances

- `german-model/`: Scripts to fine-tune [LeoLM-13b](https://huggingface.co/LeoLM/leo-hessianai-13b) on a German conversational dataset 

## Installation instructions

It's recommended to follow [Installation instructions](https://huggingface.co/LeoLM/leo-hessianai-13b) of the The Alignment Handbook repository
